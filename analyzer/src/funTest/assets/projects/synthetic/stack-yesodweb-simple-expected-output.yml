  description: "Chunk of memory, polymorphic byte array management and manipulation\n\
    \n* A polymorphic byte array abstraction and function similar to strict ByteString.\n\
    \n* Different type of byte array abstraction.\n\n* Raw memory IO operations (memory\
    \ set, memory copy, ..)\n\n* Aliasing with endianness support.\n\n* Encoding :\
    \ Base16, Base32, Base64.\n\n* Hashing : FNV, SipHash"
